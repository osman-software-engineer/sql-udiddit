# Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator

## Project Introduction:
Udiddit is a social news aggregator, content rating, and discussions website. On Udiddit, registered users are able to link to external content or post their own text content about various topics, ranging from common topics such as photography and food, to more arcane ones such as horse masks or birds with arms. In turn, other users can comment on these posts, and each user is allowed to cast a vote about each post, either in an up (like) or down (dislike) direction.

Unfortunately, due to some time constraints before the initial launch of the site, the data model stored in Postgres hasn’t been well thought out, and is starting to show its flaws. You’ve been brought in for two reasons: first, to make an assessment of the situation and take steps to fix all the issues with the current data model, and then, once successful, to improve the current system by making it more robust and adding some web analytics.

## Instructions

All your tasks are outlined in a single Google Docs document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eQ3jsuU55Vyu6iuKpIqqR0_cC8spVNwM-wyqwtLcGgQ/copy), which you should make a copy from (do not request access). A Word version of this template has also been attached at the bottom of this page. To complete the project, you’ll have to make your own copy of this document to document your findings and steps. This document will constitute your final submission for the project.

You need to complete the following in the template:

Part I: Investigate the existing schema
Part II: Create the DDL for your new schema
Part III: Migrate the provided data

# Project Rubric
Following the tasks in the Google Docs template should get you to a fully functioning project, but make sure to double-check your work against the requirements in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2802/view) as well before you submit on the last page in this lesson.
